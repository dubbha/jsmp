# Task Description
As home task, you need to develop server side of web application. Which application it will be, is up to you and your mentor. 

Main points from me are:
- Use Nodejs for creation server side
- Create some communication between client and server (REST, WebSockets, etc.)
- Use some DB (mongo, redis, etc.)
- Describe your application in readme.md in your repo.
 
You need to choose all tools with your mentor.
